Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a postdoc at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), working on wastewater surveillance for infectious diseases. My research is focused on amplicon-based sequencing of pathogens from wastewater. 

Previously, I did my PhD at the Public Health Service of Amsterdam, where I mainly worked on epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
